# wordpress-cribbage

This is a for-funnsies project I made with the goals of learning React and Test Driven Development on my own terms, and teaching my computer to play me in cribbage.

## Try It Out

Install this plugin on a WordPress site, preferably one that you use for testing, and activate it!
Then you too can play cribbage by adding `?cribbage=true` to your site's address. Enjoy!

## v2.0

I'm starting on a v2, in which I use socet.io to allow to people to play each other.
